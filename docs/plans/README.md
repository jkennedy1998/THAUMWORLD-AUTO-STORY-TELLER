# Active Development Plans

Plans are the single source of truth for “what we’re doing next” and “what is actually implemented/tested”. The newest plan(s) win.

Keep plans small and executable. If something matters, it belongs as a checkbox item here (not in ad-hoc build logs).

## Naming

- `YYYY_MM_DD_<topic>.md`
- Example: `2026_02_05_inspect_implementation_plan.md`

## Checklist Legend

- `[ ]` not_started
- `[~]` implemented
- `[x]` tested

## Design Rules

- If plans overlap, cross-link them and declare a single source of truth.
- Move completed/superseded plans to `docs/archive/`.
- Prefer updating an existing plan over creating a new “log” file.
