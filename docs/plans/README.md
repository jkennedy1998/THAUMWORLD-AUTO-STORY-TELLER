## Naming Convention

All plans use format: `YYYY_MM_DD_brief_descriptive_title.md`

Examples:
- `2026_02_02_place_system_plan.md` - Place system plan from Feb 2, 2026
- `2026_02_05_inspect_implementation_plan.md` - Inspect plan from Feb 5, 2026

This allows chronological sorting and clear versioning.
