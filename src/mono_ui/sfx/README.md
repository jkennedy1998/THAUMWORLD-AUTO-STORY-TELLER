# SFX Assets (Temporary)

This folder holds placeholder sound effects for the UI renderer.

Rules:
- Keep filenames stable; swap sounds by replacing the file contents.
- Use short, UI-friendly sounds (low latency).
- Prefer `.wav` for predictability.

Suggested files:
- `menu_click.wav`
- `speech_blip.wav`
- `footstep_stone.wav`
- `footstep_wood.wav`
